# 🔍 Trace – AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis and Impact Prediction Tool for Distributed System Reliability

**Trace** is an intelligent debugging assistant that analyzes complex system architectures to identify root causes of failures and predict their cascading impact. Built for large-scale infrastructures, CI/CD pipelines, and microservice-based systems, Trace helps engineers ensure system reliability, reduce downtime, and proactively mitigate risk.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ⚙️ **System Modeling via Directed Graphs**  
  Define your system architecture as a graph (nodes = components, edges = dependencies)

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Root Cause Detection**  
  Uses graph algorithms + optional ML models to detect the origin of failure and explain it

- 🔁 **Cascading Failure Simulation**  
  Predict how a single point of failure propagates and which components it affects

- 🔍 **Human-Readable Explanations**  
  Integrates LLMs to generate natural-language diagnostics of failure and impact

- 📊 **Heatmap Visualization & Impact Severity**  
  Identify critical paths, failure hotspots, and risk levels using graph-based scoring

- 🧪 **Failure Injection Testing Mode**  
  Simulate failures in any component and analyze system resilience

## Architecture Overview

User Input → Graph Parser → Root Cause Engine → Impact Analyzer → Explanation Generator → Visualizer

Graph Parser: Builds DAG from user input

Root Cause Engine: Traverses nodes, detects likely failure origins

Impact Analyzer: Predicts cascading impact using BFS/DFS

Explanation Generator: Uses OpenAI API for human-readable reasoning

Visualizer: Renders graph with D3.js and heatmap overlays
